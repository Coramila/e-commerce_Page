### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsiveness
- DOM
- JavaScript
- Media queries


### What I learned

With this project I have tried to apply things that I've learned with some Frontend courses. I had the opportunity to practice the use of flexbox and media queries to make the page responsive.

### Continued development

In the future, I intend to make the page more interactive, e to develop more pages.
